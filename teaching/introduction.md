# Introduction to these training modules

These modules provide step-by-step training for anyone to become a master at bioinformatics. By the end of this, you will be able to go from DNA sequences to fully annotated proteins and taxonomically identified genomes.

## 🧬 1. Getting Started

This tutorial will run entirely using Binder. To get there, go to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) and then paste this link [https://github.com/BenMinch/bioinformatic-teaching-environment](https://github.com/BenMinch/bioinformatic-teaching-environment) into the github repository URL and click launch. This will bring up an environment that already has all the bioinformatic tools and packages installed so you don't have to worry about compatibility issues. Click into the terminal to begin.

## 📁 2. Introduction to the terminal environment

The terminal environment can be daunting for those unfamiliar with it. If you want a tutorial to further acquaint yourself with it, I recommend this (one)[https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/getting-started].
